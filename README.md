# Sorting-Visualizer

A Sorting-Visualizer for numbers, words, and letters.  
Explore how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step with interactive animations and controls.

- Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms simultaneously
- Supports sorting of numbers, letters, words
- Adjustable sorting speed with slider control
- Highlights current sorting steps with easy-to-follow animations
- Shows fastest algorithm based on step count for given input
- User-friendly input area for quick testing



Supported Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort
  
Usage
Enter a list of numbers, words, or letters into the input box.

Choose input type or use Auto Detect.

Click Start Sort to visualize sorting algorithms.

Adjust the speed slider to control animation speed.

Watch the algorithms run side by side and see which one finishes fastest!

How It Works
The visualizer breaks down each algorithm into discrete steps.

Each step updates the array display with highlighted elements being compared or swapped.

The fastest algorithm is calculated dynamically based on the total number of steps.

Tech Stack
React + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS for styling

Custom hooks and components for algorithm logic and UI
